## 2026-04-02 18:20 PDT — FX.CWF.1: Fix workflow PATCH save with new states/transitions

**Done:** Root cause: frontend stripped temporary `s-new-*` IDs from states (sent `undefined`) but transitions still referenced `s-new-*` IDs for `fromStateId`/`toStateId`. Backend inserted states with server-generated IDs but transitions referenced non-existent client IDs → FK violation. Fix: (1) Backend PATCH handler now builds `stateIdMap` mapping client IDs (including `s-new-*`) to server-generated IDs, then remaps transition `fromStateId`/`toStateId` through the map. Also handles `t-new-*` transition IDs and defaults `sortOrder` to 0. (2) Frontend `handleSave` now sends client IDs as-is (no stripping) — backend handles all ID mapping. Verified: created new workflow with new states + transition, Save succeeds without error toast.

## 2026-04-02 17:55 PDT — CWF.TEST.2: Execute Custom Workflows e2e tests

**Done:** Executed 36-step e2e test plan via chrome-devtools MCP. 33 pass, 1 fail, 2 skipped. All 10 parts tested: default workflow seeding, dynamic flow view columns, state filters, move-to transitions, workflow builder (create/add states/transitions/validation/save/publish), settings workflow selector. Filed bug FX.CWF.1 — PATCH API returns 206 when saving workflow with new states (temporary IDs). 16 screenshots saved.
**Files:** `tests/e2e/results/custom-workflows/results.md`, `tests/e2e/results/custom-workflows/*.png` (16 screenshots)
**Notes:** The save bug (FX.CWF.1) is in the backend PATCH handler — likely issue with bulk state/transition replacement when IDs are undefined/new. Publish endpoint works fine.

## 2026-04-02 17:10 PDT — CWF.18: Workflow route, sidebar, API wiring

**Done:** Added `/workflows` and `/workflows/:id` routes in router.tsx. Created `pages/workflows.tsx` — list view with workflow cards + "New Workflow" button, builder view loading data from `useWorkflow()` and converting to `StateCardData[]`. Added "Workflows" (GitBranch icon) to sidebar nav. Added CRUD API client functions: `createWorkflow`, `updateWorkflow`, `publishWorkflow`, `validateWorkflowApi`, `deleteWorkflow`. Added mutation hooks: `useCreateWorkflow`, `useUpdateWorkflow`, `usePublishWorkflow`, `useDeleteWorkflow` with query invalidation. Settings workflow selector already existed from CWF.14.
**Files:** `packages/frontend/src/pages/workflows.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/router.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/components/sidebar.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/api/client.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-workflows.ts`

## 2026-04-02 16:45 PDT — CWF.17: Workflow builder main layout + validation + create dialog

**Done:** Created 3 files: `workflow-builder.tsx` — main split layout with left panel (state list with add/remove/reorder via move up/down, StateCard per state) and right panel (WorkflowPreview). Header has workflow name input, draft/published badge, Save + Publish buttons (publish disabled if validation errors). `validation-panel.tsx` — validates: exactly 1 initial state, >=1 terminal state, unreachable states, dead-ends, broken transitions. Green "valid" or red/amber error list. Exports `validateWorkflow` for reuse. `create-workflow-dialog.tsx` — Dialog with name input, Create/Cancel buttons, Enter key support.
**Files:** `packages/frontend/src/features/workflow-builder/workflow-builder.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/workflow-builder/validation-panel.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/workflow-builder/create-workflow-dialog.tsx`
**Notes:** Components not routed yet — CWF.18 adds the route, sidebar link, and API wiring.

## 2026-04-02 16:30 PDT — Review: CWF.16 (approved)

**Reviewed:** workflow-preview.tsx visual graph component.
- Read-only SVG graph with auto-layout by state type ✓
- Color-coded nodes with name + type badge ✓
- Bezier curve arrows with arrowhead markers and labels ✓
- No graph library — pure SVG ✓
- Uses SVG instead of task's "CSS grid" — correct choice since CSS grid can't draw arrows
- Empty state handled, useMemo for performance ✓
- Build passes ✓
- **Verdict: approved.**

---

## 2026-04-02 16:25 PDT — CWF.16: Workflow preview component

**Done:** Created `workflow-preview.tsx` — read-only SVG-based visual graph of workflow states and transitions. States auto-layout horizontally by type (initial → intermediate → terminal) using computed positions. Color-coded nodes with name + type badge. Curved Bezier arrows for transitions with optional labels and arrowhead markers. Empty state placeholder when no states defined. All SVG, no graph library.
**Files:** `packages/frontend/src/features/workflow-builder/workflow-preview.tsx`
**Notes:** Component not yet routable — CWF.18 will add the `/workflows/:id` route. Visual check deferred until then.

---

## 2026-04-02 16:15 PDT — CWF.15: Workflow builder state-card and transition-row

**Done:** Created `state-card.tsx` with editable StateCard component (name input, type selector, 12-color picker, persona selector via usePersonas(), transitions list with add/remove) and `transition-row.tsx` with target state dropdown + label input + delete button. Both components use shadcn/ui primitives and match compact sizing conventions.
**Files:** `packages/frontend/src/features/workflow-builder/state-card.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/workflow-builder/transition-row.tsx`

## 2026-04-02 15:50 PDT — CWF.14: Update workflow-config-section for dynamic workflow

**Done:** Updated `packages/frontend/src/features/settings/workflow-config-section.tsx`. Replaced `WORKFLOW.states` import with `useWorkflowStates(project.workflowId)`. `configurableStates` now filters by `type === "intermediate"` instead of hardcoded names. Added `WorkflowSelector` component — dropdown shown when 2+ workflows exist, allows changing project's active workflow. Updated note text to reference initial/terminal states generically. Imported `useWorkflowStates` + `useWorkflows` from hooks.
**Files:** `packages/frontend/src/features/settings/workflow-config-section.tsx`
**Notes:** Frontend Dynamic Views phase (CWF.11-14) complete. All work-items + settings views now use dynamic workflow data.

## 2026-04-02 15:40 PDT — Review: CWF.13 (approved)

**Reviewed:** list-view, filter-bar, detail-panel dynamic workflow.
- filter-bar: state dropdown from useWorkflowStates(), no WORKFLOW ✓
- list-view: stateColorMap + getStateColor, group ordering dynamic, stateColor prop on ListRow ✓
- detail-panel: "Move to" from useWorkflowTransitions(), ChildrenList stateColorMap ✓
- No hardcoded WORKFLOW/getStateByName/getValidTransitions in any of the 3 files ✓
- Build passes ✓

---

## 2026-04-02 15:35 PDT — CWF.13: Update list-view, filter-bar, detail-panel for dynamic workflow

**Done:** Updated 3 frontend files. `filter-bar.tsx`: replaced `WORKFLOW.states` import with `useWorkflowStates()` for state filter dropdown options. `list-view.tsx`: replaced `WORKFLOW` and `getStateByName` with `useWorkflowStates()` + `stateColorMap`/`getStateColor` helper. State group ordering uses dynamic `workflowStatesData`. Added `stateColor` prop to `ListRow`. `detail-panel.tsx`: replaced `getStateByName`/`getValidTransitions` with `useWorkflowStates()`/`useWorkflowTransitions()`. `StateTransitionControl` receives workflow data as props for "Move to" dropdown. `ChildrenList` receives `stateColorMap` for child state colors.
**Files:** `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/filter-bar.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/list-view.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/detail-panel.tsx`

## 2026-04-02 14:55 PDT — CWF.11: Frontend workflow hooks and API client

**Done:** Created `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-workflows.ts` with 4 React Query hooks: `useWorkflows(projectId?)`, `useWorkflow(id)`, `useWorkflowStates(workflowId)`, `useWorkflowTransitions(workflowId)`. All with 5-minute staleTime. Added 4 API client functions in `client.ts`: `getWorkflows()`, `getWorkflow()` (returns workflow + states + transitions), `getWorkflowStates()`, `getWorkflowTransitions()`. Exported from api/index.ts. Imported shared types (`Workflow`, `WorkflowStateEntity`, `WorkflowTransitionEntity`).

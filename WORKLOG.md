## 2026-03-30 — E.9: Add execution error handling and UI feedback

**Task:** Verify error handling pipeline, add toast on failure, add retry button in detail panel.

**Verification (already working):**
1. Execution record updated to `failed` in DB — execution-manager.ts catch block sets `status: "failed"`, `outcome: "failure"`, error in summary/logs ✓
2. Failure broadcast via WS — catch block broadcasts `agent_completed` with `outcome: "failure"` ✓
3. Agent monitor shows error — terminal renderer streams all chunks including `FATAL:` error messages. Execution hook shows `status: "failed"` ✓
4. Work item does NOT advance state — routing chain only fires on `finalOutcome === "success"` ✓
5. Toast on failure — `use-toast-events.ts` already handles `agent_completed` with failure: shows error toast with "Agent failed" title and "View" action ✓

**New features added:**
- **`POST /api/work-items/:id/retry` route** — Re-dispatches the persona for the work item's current state. Returns 404 if work item doesn't exist. Fire-and-forget dispatch.
- **`retryWorkItem()` API client** — Added to real client, mock API, and unified API index.
- **Retry button in ExecutionTimeline** — Shows a "Retry" button (RotateCcw icon) below the badges row for failed executions. Calls `retryWorkItem()`, shows info/error toast on success/failure.
- **2 new tests** — retry dispatch for existing item (200), retry for non-existent (404).

**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/routes/work-items.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/__tests__/work-items.test.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/api/client.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/mocks/api.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/api/index.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/features/common/execution-timeline.tsx`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. Tests: 153/153 passing (was 151). Most of E.9 was already working — the execution-manager and toast system were properly handling failures. The retry button was the main new UI feature.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: E.8 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Parent-child coordination dispatch fix — `coordination.ts`, `coordination.test.ts`.
- `dispatchForState(parentId, "In Review")` called after DB update + WS broadcast ✓
- Fire-and-forget with `.catch()` — consistent with dispatch pattern elsewhere ✓
- No circular dependency: coordination→dispatch→execution-manager chain verified ✓
- Test: dispatch called with correct args on all-children-Done ✓
- Test: dispatch NOT called on partial-done and already-in-target-state ✓
- Existing tests (blocked comment, top-level no-op) still pass ✓
- Build: 0 errors, Tests: 151/151
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — E.8: Fix parent-child coordination in real flow

**Task:** Verify and fix parent-child coordination: auto-advance parent when all children Done, system comment on child Blocked, frontend reactive updates.

**Bug found and fixed:**

- **Bug: No dispatch after parent auto-advance** — When `coordination.ts` auto-advanced a parent to "In Review" (all children Done), it updated the DB and broadcast WS events but **never called `dispatchForState()`**. This meant no reviewer persona was dispatched to actually review the parent work item. Fixed by importing `dispatchForState` and calling it after the parent state update.

**Verification:**
1. All children Done → parent auto-advances to "In Review" ✓ (existing test)
2. Auto-advance now triggers `dispatchForState(parentId, "In Review")` → reviewer persona dispatched ✓ (new assertion)
3. Partial children Done → parent stays put, no dispatch ✓ (new assertion)
4. Parent already "In Review" → no redundant advance or dispatch ✓ (new assertion)
5. Child Blocked → system comment posted on parent ✓ (existing test)
6. Top-level items → no-op ✓ (existing test)
7. Frontend WS sync: `state_change` → invalidates `workItems`+`dashboardStats`, `comment_created` → invalidates `comments` ✓
8. No circular dependency: coordination→dispatch→execution-manager (dispatch doesn't import coordination) ✓

**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/agent/coordination.ts`, `packages/backend/src/agent/__tests__/coordination.test.ts`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. Tests: 151/151 passing. The fix is small but critical — without it, the parent would sit in "In Review" with no persona ever running to review it.

---

## 2026-03-30 — Review: E.7 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Settings field name standardization and dispatch pipeline verification.
- `maxConcurrentAgents`→`maxConcurrent`, `monthlyCostCap`→`monthCap` in seed, dashboard, fixtures, mock API ✓
- No stale references to old field names remain ✓
- Critical bug: monthly cost cap was silently never enforced (returned 0 = no cap) ✓
- Pipeline trace: route → dispatch → cost cap → concurrency → execution → router chain verified ✓
- Auto-routing ON/OFF: router.ts `autoRouting === false` guard tested with 3 cases ✓
- 6 new tests (cost cap block/allow, routing on/off/default/nonexistent) ✓
- Coordination gap correctly scoped to E.8 ✓
- Build: 0 errors, Tests: 151/151
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — E.7: Fix dispatch trigger on state change

**Task:** Verify and fix the full dispatch pipeline: routes → dispatch → execution-manager → router.

**Bugs found and fixed:**

- **Bug: Settings field name mismatch** — The seed (`seed.ts`) and frontend fixtures used `maxConcurrentAgents` and `monthlyCostCap`, but the runtime code (`concurrency.ts`) reads `maxConcurrent` and `monthCap`. This meant the monthly cost cap was **never enforced** (returned 0 = no cap). Concurrency limit coincidentally worked because both the fallback default and the seed value were 3.
- **Fixed in seed.ts**: `{ maxConcurrentAgents: 3, monthlyCostCap: 50 }` → `{ maxConcurrent: 3, monthCap: 50 }`
- **Fixed in dashboard.ts**: `settings.monthlyCostCap` → `settings.monthCap`
- **Fixed in frontend fixtures.ts**: Same field name fix + added `autoRouting: true`
- **Fixed in frontend mocks/api.ts**: `settings.monthlyCostCap` → `settings.monthCap`

**Verification (pipeline trace):**
1. PATCH `/api/work-items/:id` with `currentState` → validates transition → calls `dispatchForState()` ✓
2. `dispatchForState()` → looks up persona assignment → checks monthly cost cap → checks concurrency → calls `runExecution()` ✓
3. `runExecution()` → creates DB record → streams execution → on success calls `runRouter()` (for non-Router personas) ✓
4. `runRouter()` → checks `autoRouting === false` → if OFF, returns false (no routing) ✓
5. Router completes → `dispatchForState()` for new state → next persona fires ✓
6. Rate limiter (`canTransition`, 10/hr per item) prevents infinite loops ✓

**New tests added:**
- `dispatch.test.ts`: "blocks dispatch when monthly cost cap is exceeded" — sets monthCap to $0.01, verifies execution blocked and system comment posted
- `dispatch.test.ts`: "allows dispatch when cost is under monthly cap" — verifies normal dispatch works
- `router.test.ts`: "routes when autoRouting is true" — verifies router spawns
- `router.test.ts`: "skips routing when autoRouting is false" — verifies no execution
- `router.test.ts`: "routes by default when autoRouting is not set" — verifies default ON behavior
- `router.test.ts`: "returns false for non-existent work item"

**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/db/seed.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/mocks/fixtures.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/mocks/api.ts`, `packages/backend/src/agent/__tests__/dispatch.test.ts`, `packages/backend/src/agent/__tests__/router.test.ts` (new)

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. Tests: 151/151 passing (was 145). The one gap not fixed here: `coordination.ts` auto-advances parent to "In Review" but doesn't call `dispatchForState()` — that's E.8's scope.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: E.6 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Pipeline walkthrough fixes — `work-items.ts`, `work-items.test.ts`.
- State transition validation: `isValidTransition()` check before DB update, 400 for invalid ✓
- `previousState` scoping: `let` declaration outside block, assigned inside, guarded in dispatch ✓
- WS broadcast: `state_change` event with correct fields, fires after DB update, before dispatch ✓
- Test updated: expects 400 + `INVALID_TRANSITION` for Backlog→Done ✓
- Walkthrough: 7 steps documented, 2 bugs found and fixed ✓
- Build: 0 errors, Tests: 145/145
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — E.6: Manual pipeline walkthrough and fix

**Task:** Walk a work item through the full lifecycle via API, fix integration bugs found.

**Walkthrough results:**
1. **Seed runs**: 1 project, 5 personas, 16 items, 5 assignments — all data loads correctly via API
2. **Create work item**: `POST /api/work-items` → created in Backlog ✓
3. **Move to Planning**: `PATCH` with `currentState: "Planning"` → dispatch fires, PM persona execution created (status: completed/failure — expected, no Claude SDK configured) ✓
4. **Move Ready → In Progress**: Engineer persona dispatched correctly ✓
5. **Work item stays in state after failed execution**: Execution failure doesn't advance state ✓
6. **Dashboard stats**: Returns correct counts from seeded data ✓
7. **Persona assignments**: All 5 state→persona mappings return correctly ✓

**Bugs found and fixed:**
- **Bug #1: No state transition validation** — PATCH route accepted any `currentState` value (e.g., Backlog → Done). Fixed by adding `isValidTransition()` check before update. Returns 400 `INVALID_TRANSITION` for invalid transitions.
- **Bug #2: No `state_change` WS broadcast** — PATCH route didn't broadcast `state_change` events when state changed. Frontend WS sync (E.2) relies on this to invalidate queries. Fixed by adding `broadcast({ type: "state_change", ... })` after successful state update.
- **Test updated**: Changed `"allows invalid state transition"` test to `"rejects invalid state transition"` — now expects 400 with INVALID_TRANSITION code.

**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/routes/work-items.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/__tests__/work-items.test.ts`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. Tests: 145/145 passing. The Claude executor fails without a real API key — expected. The dispatch pipeline (route → dispatch → concurrency check → execution record creation) works end-to-end.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: E.5 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Realistic pipeline seed — `seed.ts`, `router.ts`, `execution-manager.ts`.
- Project has `autoRouting: true` ✓
- 5 personas with detailed system prompts (PM, Tech Lead, Engineer, Code Reviewer, Router) ✓
- Persona assignments for 5 workflow states ✓
- Router persona matches `getOrCreateRouterPersona` fallback (color, icon, isSystem) ✓
- Router executions (EXEC_9, EXEC_10) show routing decisions ✓
- `__router__` → `"Router"` rename consistent across all files ✓
- Comment authorNames match new persona names ✓
- Build: 0 errors, Tests: 145/145
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — E.5: Create development seed with realistic pipeline data

**Task:** Update seed.ts with autoRouting, 5 personas with real system prompts, persona assignments for all workflow states, and realistic pipeline data.

**Done:**
- **Project settings**: Added `autoRouting: true` to project settings
- **Replaced QA with Router persona**: New `ps-rt00001` persona named "Router" with proper system prompt matching the router agent's behavior. Removed QA persona.
- **Real system prompts**: All 5 personas (Product Manager, Tech Lead, Engineer, Code Reviewer, Router) now have detailed, multi-paragraph system prompts with responsibilities, guidelines, and available tools
- **Persona assignments for 5 states**: Planning→PM, Decomposition→Tech Lead, Ready→Router, In Progress→Engineer, In Review→Code Reviewer
- **Router executions seeded**: Added EXEC_9 (router routes auth task to Done) and EXEC_10 (router routes auth from Planning→Decomposition) to show routing in action
- **Router comments seeded**: Added cm-cmt0016 (reviewer comment) and cm-cmt0017 (router state transition comment)
- **Backend router name fix**: Changed `"__router__"` → `"Router"` in `router.ts` and `execution-manager.ts` so the seeded persona is recognized by the backend
- **Persona names updated**: "PM" → "Product Manager", "Reviewer" → "Code Reviewer" in seed comments

**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/db/seed.ts`, `packages/backend/src/agent/router.ts`, `packages/backend/src/agent/execution-manager.ts`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. Tests: 145/145 passing. Seed now has: 1 project, 5 personas, 16 work items, 4 edges, 5 assignments, 10 executions, 17 comments, 2 proposals, 2 memories. Frontend mock fixtures (QA persona) left unchanged — they're independent mock-mode data.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: E.4 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Wire activity feed to real WebSocket events — `activity-feed.tsx`, `recent-activity.tsx`, `client.ts`, `mocks/api.ts`, `api/index.ts`, `query-keys.ts`, `use-comments.ts`, `hooks/index.ts`.
- `fixtures` import fully removed from both activity components ✓
- `getRecentComments()` added to real client, mock API, and unified index ✓
- `useRecentComments()` hook with `["comments", "recent"]` query key ✓
- Both components null-guard comments data and include in `useMemo` deps ✓
- Hardcoded mock events (router decision, cost alert) removed ✓
- Live WS events (`useLiveActivityEvents` + `wsEventToActivity`) unchanged ✓
- WS invalidation: `["comments"]` prefix covers `["comments", "recent"]` ✓
- Minor: stale comment "Build events from mock data" at line 191 — cosmetic only
- Build: 0 errors
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — E.4: Wire activity feed to real WebSocket events

**Task:** Replace mock data (`fixtures.comments`, hardcoded events) in activity feed and dashboard recent activity with real API calls. Keep live WS event streaming.

**Done:**
- **Added `getRecentComments()`** to both real API client (`/api/comments` without workItemId) and mock API (returns all `store.comments` sorted by date)
- **Wired through unified API index** (`api/index.ts`) with mock/real delegation
- **Added `recentComments` query key** to `query-keys.ts` — `["comments", "recent"]`, inherits invalidation from `["comments"]` prefix match
- **Added `useRecentComments()` hook** in `use-comments.ts`, exported from hooks index
- **Updated `activity-feed.tsx`**: replaced `fixtures.comments` with `useRecentComments()` data, removed hardcoded router decision and cost alert mock events, removed `fixtures` import
- **Updated `recent-activity.tsx`**: same fix — replaced `fixtures.comments` with `useRecentComments()`, removed `fixtures` import, wrapped in `useMemo` since it now depends on query data
- **Live WS events unchanged**: `useLiveActivityEvents()` and `wsEventToActivity()` already work correctly — they subscribe to all WS event types and prepend live events with `isLive: true` flag

**Files modified:** `api/client.ts`, `mocks/api.ts`, `api/index.ts`, `hooks/query-keys.ts`, `hooks/use-comments.ts`, `hooks/index.ts`, `features/activity-feed/activity-feed.tsx`, `features/dashboard/recent-activity.tsx`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. The `["comments"]` prefix in WS sync already invalidates both `["comments", { workItemId }]` and `["comments", "recent"]`, so live comment events refresh the activity feed automatically.

---

## 2026-03-30 — Review: E.3 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Wire agent monitor to real WebSocket streaming — `terminal-renderer.tsx`, `ws-client.ts`, `ws.ts`, `use-ws-sync.ts`.
- Terminal renderer already correctly subscribed to `agent_output_chunk` events and maps `event.chunk`/`event.chunkType` to `OutputChunk` — no changes needed ✓
- `onReconnect(callback)` method added to `RealWsClient` with `reconnectCallbacks` Set ✓
- Exposed through unified `ws.ts` module ✓
- `useWsQuerySync` registers reconnect handler invalidating `["executions"]`, `["workItems"]`, `["dashboardStats"]` ✓
- Cleanup returns both `unsub()` and `unsubReconnect()` ✓
- Minor note: `isReconnect` heuristic on line 52 of ws-client.ts is fragile (can false-positive on first connect) but practical impact is negligible
- Build: 0 errors
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — Review: E.2 (approved)

**Reviewed:** WS→Query cache invalidation — `use-ws-sync.ts`.
- `state_change` → `["workItems"]` + `["dashboardStats"]` (fixes stale `["stories"]`/`["tasks"]`) ✓
- `comment_created` → `["comments"]` ✓
- `agent_started`/`agent_completed`/`execution_update` → `["executions"]` + `["dashboardStats"]` ✓
- `proposal_created`/`proposal_updated` → `["proposals"]` + `["dashboardStats"]` ✓
- `cost_update` → `["dashboardStats"]` + `["costSummary"]` ✓
- All keys cross-checked against `query-keys.ts` — prefix matching covers all variants ✓
- 8 of 9 event types handled (`agent_output_chunk` correctly omitted — streaming, not cache) ✓
- Hook wired in RootLayout, cleanup via `return unsub` ✓
- Build: 0 errors
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — E.3: Wire agent monitor to real WebSocket streaming

**Task:** Connect terminal renderer to real `agent_output_chunk` WS events. Handle reconnection with re-fetch of active executions.

**Done:**
- **Terminal renderer already wired**: `subscribe("agent_output_chunk", ...)` was already mapping `event.chunk` + `event.chunkType` to `OutputChunk` type. The `processChunks` function pairs `tool_call`/`tool_result` via `toolCallId`. No changes needed to terminal-renderer.tsx.
- **Backend event shape verified**: `execution-manager.ts` broadcasts `{ type, executionId, personaId, chunk, chunkType, timestamp }` — matches `AgentOutputChunkEvent` interface exactly.
- **Reconnection callback**: Added `onReconnect(callback)` method to `RealWsClient` class. Fires registered callbacks when WS connection reopens after a disconnect. Exposed via unified `ws.ts` module.
- **Re-fetch on reconnect**: In `useWsQuerySync`, registered a reconnect handler that invalidates `["executions"]`, `["workItems"]`, and `["dashboardStats"]` — so split-view's active execution list refreshes automatically.

**Files modified:** `ws-client.ts`, `ws.ts`, `use-ws-sync.ts`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. The `isReconnect` heuristic checks if listeners exist (meaning the app has been running). Terminal renderer didn't need changes — it was already correctly subscribing and mapping events from Sprint 5.

---

## 2026-03-30 — E.2: Wire TanStack Query cache invalidation to WebSocket events

**Task:** Subscribe to WS events and invalidate the correct TanStack Query cache keys for reactive UI updates.

**Done:**
- **Fixed stale query keys**: `state_change` was invalidating `["stories"]` and `["tasks"]` (old Sprint 1 names) — replaced with `["workItems"]` to match current query-keys.ts.
- **Verified all event→key mappings** against query-keys.ts:
  - `state_change` → `["workItems"]` + `["dashboardStats"]`
  - `comment_created` → `["comments"]`
  - `agent_started` / `agent_completed` / `execution_update` → `["executions"]` + `["dashboardStats"]`
  - `proposal_created` / `proposal_updated` → `["proposals"]` + `["dashboardStats"]`
  - `cost_update` → `["dashboardStats"]` + `["costSummary"]`
- **Cleaned up comments**: Removed stale references to "stories/tasks" and "mock WebSocket".
- **Already wired**: Hook is called once in RootLayout via `useWsQuerySync()` — no additional wiring needed.

**Files modified:** `use-ws-sync.ts`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. The `subscribeAll` function from `@/api/ws` works with both mock and real WS clients (unified module). TanStack Query's prefix matching ensures `["workItems"]` invalidates all workItem queries (list, single, filtered).

## 2026-03-30 — Review: E.1 (approved)

**Reviewed:** API client response parsing and error handling — `client.ts`.
- Response shape audit: all list endpoints `{ data, total }` unwrapped correctly ✓
- Single-entity endpoints `{ data }` unwrapped correctly ✓
- Dashboard flat endpoints (stats, cost-summary, execution-stats) read directly ✓
- JSON columns auto-deserialized by Drizzle, no manual parsing needed ✓
- `showErrorToast()` via `useToastStore.getState().addToast()` — correct external Zustand access ✓
- All 5 helpers (get/post/patch/put/del) fire toast before throwing ✓
- `del` fires toast but returns `res.ok` (no throw) — consistent with existing contract ✓
- Build: 0 errors, 145 tests pass
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — E.1: Fix API client response parsing

**Task:** Audit API client response shapes vs backend routes. Add error handling with toast notifications on failure.

**Done:**
- **Audit results**: All response shapes match between frontend client and backend routes:
  - List endpoints return `{ data, total }` — client unwraps `res.data` ✓
  - Single-entity endpoints return `{ data }` — client unwraps `res.data` ✓
  - Dashboard stats/cost-summary/execution-stats return flat objects — client reads directly ✓
  - Dashboard ready-work returns `{ data, total }` — client unwraps ✓
  - JSON columns (`labels`, `executionContext`, `context`, `settings`) auto-deserialized by Drizzle — no manual parsing needed ✓
  - Serializers convert dates to ISO strings, cast branded IDs — matches shared types ✓
- **Error handling**: Added `showErrorToast()` helper using `useToastStore.getState().addToast()` (Zustand external access). All 5 HTTP helpers (get, post, patch, put, del) now show error toasts with method, path, and status code before throwing.
- **No response shape fixes needed**: The API client was already correctly aligned with backend routes. The double-encoding bugs were fixed in Sprint 9 (Q.4-Q.6).

**Files modified:** `client.ts`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors, 145 tests pass. Used Zustand's `getState()` for external store access from non-React code. Toast shows "API request failed" with "GET /api/... returned 404" description.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: P.12 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Hover states and transitions — `list-view.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `detail-panel.tsx`.
- List rows: `hover:bg-muted/50` + `duration-150`, selected `ring-2 ring-primary/50`, `focus-visible:ring-2` ✓
- Group headers: `duration-150`, `rounded-md`, `focus-visible:ring-2` ✓
- Expand chevron: `transition-colors duration-150`, `focus-visible:ring-2` ✓
- Card: `transition-shadow duration-150 hover:shadow-md` applied globally ✓
- Detail panel children: `hover:bg-muted/50 duration-150 focus-visible:ring-2` ✓
- Buttons correctly left unchanged (CVA already handles hover+focus) ✓
- Consistent `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring` pattern on all non-button interactive elements ✓
- Build: 0 errors
- Verdict: **approved** — Sprint 10 complete!

---

## 2026-03-30 — P.12: Polish hover states and transitions

**Task:** Audit all interactive elements for hover feedback, add consistent transitions, focus-visible rings, and selected state styling.

**Done:**
- **List view rows**: Changed hover from `bg-accent/50` → `bg-muted/50` (subtler). Added `duration-150` for faster transition. Selected state now uses `ring-2 ring-primary/50` alongside `bg-accent`. Added `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring`.
- **List view group headers**: Added `duration-150`, `rounded-md`, and `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring`.
- **List view expand chevron**: Added `transition-colors duration-150` and `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring`.
- **Card component**: Added `transition-shadow duration-150 hover:shadow-md` for subtle lift effect on all cards.
- **Detail panel children rows**: Changed hover from `bg-accent/50` → `bg-muted/50`, added `duration-150` and `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring`.
- **Buttons**: Already have comprehensive hover states via CVA variants and `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` — no changes needed.

**Files modified:** `list-view.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `detail-panel.tsx`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. Buttons already had good hover+focus via shadcn CVA config. PrioritySelector and StateTransitionControl use shadcn Select (already interactive with proper states). The `ring-primary/50` selected ring provides a consistent active indicator.

---

## 2026-03-30 — Review: P.11 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Loading skeletons and empty states — `list-view.tsx`, `detail-panel.tsx`, `dashboard.tsx`.
- List view: 5-row skeleton with badge+text+avatar shimmer pattern ✓
- Empty states: filter-aware messaging ("No items match" vs "No work items yet") ✓
- Detail panel: loading skeleton (title+badges+content), children empty message ✓
- Dashboard: shimmer placeholder replaces "—" text during loading ✓
- Flow view + comment stream correctly identified as already handled ✓
- Build: 0 errors
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — P.11: Add loading and empty states

**Task:** Add skeleton loading states and empty state messaging across the app.

**Done:**
- **List view**: Improved loading skeleton from plain bars to badge+text+avatar shimmer pattern (5 rows). Added empty states: "No work items yet. Click + to create one." when no items, "No items match your filters." when filters active.
- **Detail panel**: Added loading skeleton (title bar + badges + content placeholders) when item is selected but data not yet loaded. Children section now shows "No children. Click 'Add child' or 'Decompose'." instead of hiding entirely.
- **Dashboard**: Stat card values show shimmer placeholder (`h-8 w-12 animate-pulse`) when loading instead of "—" text.
- **Flow view**: Already had node placeholder skeletons — no changes needed.
- **Comment stream**: Already had "No comments yet." empty state — no changes needed.

**Files modified:** `list-view.tsx`, `detail-panel.tsx`, `dashboard.tsx`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. Used `&apos;` for HTML entity in JSX string. Empty state detection checks all filter types (search, state, priority, personas, labels).

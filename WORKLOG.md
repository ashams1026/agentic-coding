## 2026-03-30 — AI.V1: Update test plan template with visual inspection

**Task:** Update `tests/e2e/plans/_template.md` to include visual inspection protocol.

**Done:**
- Added visual inspection protocol note at top of Steps section: screenshot after each major step, examine with Read tool, note visual issues
- Added "Screenshot checkpoint" annotations to each step type (Navigate, Verify, Click, final)
- Added "Visual Quality" subsection to Expected Results: layout alignment, text readability, element sizing, spacing consistency, color correctness, responsive, dark mode
- Added "Visual Failure Criteria" subsection: overlap/clipping, invisible text, broken layout, inconsistent spacing, broken colors, content truncation
- Updated Prerequisites to mention port 5174 alternative and chrome-devtools MCP

**Files changed:** `tests/e2e/plans/_template.md`

**Notes:** Build passes (no code changes, only markdown template). This template guides AI.V2-V11 tasks for updating each existing test plan.

## 2026-03-30 — QF.1: Add API mode toggle to the UI

**Task:** Add Mock/Live toggle to status bar and Settings → Appearance, with health check on switch to Live.

**Done:**
- **Status bar** (`packages/frontend/src/components/status-bar.tsx`): Added clickable Mock/Live toggle with colored indicator (amber dot for Mock, green dot for Live). Clicking toggles `apiMode` in `useUIStore`. On switch to Live: fetches `GET /api/health` — if fails, shows error toast "Backend not running. Start it with `pnpm --filter backend dev`" and reverts. On success: calls `setApiMode("api")` + `initWsConnection()`.
- **Settings → Appearance** (`packages/frontend/src/features/settings/appearance-section.tsx`): Added `ApiModeSection` component at top of Appearance section. Two card buttons (Mock/Live) with colored dots, same health check logic. Description: "Mock mode uses demo data. Live mode connects to the backend API at localhost:3001."

**Files modified:** `packages/frontend/src/components/status-bar.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/settings/appearance-section.tsx`

**Notes:** Both toggle sites share the same pattern: check health → show toast on failure → set mode + init WS on success. Imports `API_BASE_URL` from `@/api/client`, `initWsConnection` from `@/api/ws`, `useToastStore` for error toasts. Build: 0 errors.

**Reviewed:** Work Items filtering/search and sorting test plans.
- `work-items-filtering.md`: 14 steps — search input ("Search items..." matches source), debounced filtering, `HighlightedText` yellow highlighting, clear via X icon, state filter ("All states" dropdown matches source), priority filter ("All priorities"), combined filters (state AND priority), "Clear" button (matches source text, hidden via `hasFilters`), zero-results "No items match your filters." (matches list-view.tsx empty state) ✓

## 2026-03-30 — AI.6: Write test plans for Work Items — Filtering and Search

**Task:** Create test plans for work items filtering/search and sorting.

**Done:**
- **`tests/e2e/plans/work-items-filtering.md`** — 14 steps: type in search box ("Search items..." placeholder) → list filters in real-time with debounce, verify search highlighting (yellow/amber background on matches), clear search via X icon, select state filter ("All states" dropdown → specific state), verify only matching-state items shown, add priority filter on top ("All priorities" → e.g. P1), verify combined filters (state AND priority), click "Clear" button (X icon) to reset all filters and restore full list, verify "Clear" hidden when no filters active, filter to zero results → "No items match your filters." message.
- **`tests/e2e/plans/work-items-sorting.md`** — 12 steps: verify default "Sort by priority", note current order, change to "Sort by created" → list reorders, verify sort direction arrow button (up/down), toggle direction → list reverses, change to "Sort by updated", toggle back, return to "Sort by priority".

**Files created:** `tests/e2e/plans/work-items-filtering.md`, `tests/e2e/plans/work-items-sorting.md`

**Notes:** Plans reference actual filter-bar.tsx UI: search Input with debounce, state/priority Select dropdowns, "Clear" Button with X (shown when `hasFilters`), sort Select ("Sort by priority"/"Sort by created"/"Sort by updated"), sort direction toggle Button (ArrowUp/ArrowDown). Also references list-view.tsx: HighlightedText component for search highlighting, empty filter state "No items match your filters." Build: 0 errors.

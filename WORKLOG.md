## 2026-03-30 — Review: QF.1 (approved)

**Reviewed:** API mode toggle in status bar and Settings → Appearance.
- Status bar: clickable button with amber dot "Mock" / green dot "Live" ✓
- Settings → Appearance: `ApiModeSection` card-style selector at top, description matches requirement verbatim ✓
- Health check: `fetch(API_BASE_URL + "/api/health")` before switching to Live ✓
- Toast on failure: "Backend not running" / "Start it with `pnpm --filter backend dev`" ✓
- Revert on failure: `return` before `setApiMode` — mode stays on Mock ✓
- `initWsConnection()` called after `setApiMode` — Zustand sync update ensures correct mode read ✓
- No health check when switching Live→Mock (correct) ✓
- `useCallback` with proper deps, clean imports ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

## 2026-03-30 — QF.1: Add API mode toggle to the UI

**Task:** Add Mock/Live toggle to status bar and Settings → Appearance, with health check on switch to Live.

**Done:**
- **Status bar** (`packages/frontend/src/components/status-bar.tsx`): Added clickable Mock/Live toggle with colored indicator (amber dot for Mock, green dot for Live). Clicking toggles `apiMode` in `useUIStore`. On switch to Live: fetches `GET /api/health` — if fails, shows error toast "Backend not running. Start it with `pnpm --filter backend dev`" and reverts. On success: calls `setApiMode("api")` + `initWsConnection()`.
- **Settings → Appearance** (`packages/frontend/src/features/settings/appearance-section.tsx`): Added `ApiModeSection` component at top of Appearance section. Two card buttons (Mock/Live) with colored dots, same health check logic. Description: "Mock mode uses demo data. Live mode connects to the backend API at localhost:3001."

**Files modified:** `packages/frontend/src/components/status-bar.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/settings/appearance-section.tsx`

**Notes:** Both toggle sites share the same pattern: check health → show toast on failure → set mode + init WS on success. Imports `API_BASE_URL` from `@/api/client`, `initWsConnection` from `@/api/ws`, `useToastStore` for error toasts. Build: 0 errors.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: AI.6 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Work Items filtering/search and sorting test plans.
- `work-items-filtering.md`: 14 steps — search input ("Search items..." matches source), debounced filtering, `HighlightedText` yellow highlighting, clear via X icon, state filter ("All states" dropdown matches source), priority filter ("All priorities"), combined filters (state AND priority), "Clear" button (matches source text, hidden via `hasFilters`), zero-results "No items match your filters." (matches list-view.tsx empty state) ✓
- `work-items-sorting.md`: 12 steps — "Sort by priority" default, "Sort by created"/"Sort by updated" (match source dropdown texts), sort direction ArrowUp/ArrowDown toggle, order reversal verification ✓
- Template format ✓, UI references match actual source text ✓
- Build: no code changes ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

## 2026-03-30 — AI.6: Write test plans for Work Items — Filtering and Search

**Task:** Create test plans for work items filtering/search and sorting.

**Done:**
- **`tests/e2e/plans/work-items-filtering.md`** — 14 steps: type in search box ("Search items..." placeholder) → list filters in real-time with debounce, verify search highlighting (yellow/amber background on matches), clear search via X icon, select state filter ("All states" dropdown → specific state), verify only matching-state items shown, add priority filter on top ("All priorities" → e.g. P1), verify combined filters (state AND priority), click "Clear" button (X icon) to reset all filters and restore full list, verify "Clear" hidden when no filters active, filter to zero results → "No items match your filters." message.
- **`tests/e2e/plans/work-items-sorting.md`** — 12 steps: verify default "Sort by priority", note current order, change to "Sort by created" → list reorders, verify sort direction arrow button (up/down), toggle direction → list reverses, change to "Sort by updated", toggle back, return to "Sort by priority".

**Files created:** `tests/e2e/plans/work-items-filtering.md`, `tests/e2e/plans/work-items-sorting.md`

**Notes:** Plans reference actual filter-bar.tsx UI: search Input with debounce, state/priority Select dropdowns, "Clear" Button with X (shown when `hasFilters`), sort Select ("Sort by priority"/"Sort by created"/"Sort by updated"), sort direction toggle Button (ArrowUp/ArrowDown). Also references list-view.tsx: HighlightedText component for search highlighting, empty filter state "No items match your filters." Build: 0 errors.

- `detail-panel-edit.md`: 17 steps — all 5 edits tested: title inline edit (click→input→Enter), description Write/Preview tabs (Edit→textarea→Preview→Save), priority dropdown change, label add ("+ label"→input→Enter), state transition ("Move to…" + TransitionPrompt dialog "Skip" handling). Persistence verified: full page reload + reopen + verify all 5 mutations ✓
- Template format ✓, UI references by visible text ✓
- Build: no code changes ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

- **`tests/e2e/plans/detail-panel-edit.md`** — 17 steps: click title → inline edit → type "Updated Test Title" → Enter saves, Edit description → Write/Preview tabs → type text → Preview tab → Save, change priority via dropdown (e.g. P0 Critical), add label via "+ label" button → type "test-label" → Enter, change state via "Move to…" dropdown (handles Trigger Agent dialog with Skip), full page reload → reopen same item → verify all 5 mutations persisted (title, description, priority, labels, state).

**Files created:** `tests/e2e/plans/detail-panel-view.md`, `tests/e2e/plans/detail-panel-edit.md`

**Notes:** Plans reference actual components from `detail-panel.tsx`: EditableTitle (click→input, Enter saves, Escape cancels), EditableDescription (Write/Preview tabs, Save/Cancel buttons), PrioritySelector (Select with colored dots), LabelEditor (badges + "+ label" inline input), StateTransitionControl ("Move to…" Select), TransitionPrompt dialog (Run/Skip/Cancel), ChildrenList, CommentStream, ExecutionTimeline, MetadataSection.

## 2026-03-30 — AI.4: Write test plans for Work Items — Flow View

**Task:** Create test plan for work items flow view.

**Done:**
- **`tests/e2e/plans/work-items-flow-view.md`** — 13 steps: navigate to `/items?view=flow`, verify all 8 state nodes (Backlog, Planning, Decomposition, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done, Blocked — 7 in row + Blocked below center), verify item count badges on each node, verify agent status ("idle" or "N active" with green pulsing dot), verify SVG arrows with arrowheads between states following `WORKFLOW.transitions`, cross-check node count sum against list view total, click state node to show filtered items panel (colored dot + state name + count + item rows with priority/title/persona), click item to select and open detail panel, click node again to deselect, click zero-count node to see "No items in this state." message.

**Files created:** `tests/e2e/plans/work-items-flow-view.md`

**Notes:** Plan references actual layout from `flow-view.tsx`: static positions computed from `WORKFLOW.states`, `computeArrowPath` for SVG arrows, `StateNode` component (colored header, count badge, active agents indicator, avatar stack, progress bar), `FilteredItemsList` below graph on node click, toggle filter via `handleNodeClick`. Build: 0 errors.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: AI.2 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Dashboard test plans (dashboard-stats.md, dashboard-navigation.md).
- `dashboard-stats.md`: 11 steps — navigates to `/`, verifies all 4 stat cards (Active Agents, Pending Proposals, Needs Attention, Today's Cost) with numeric values, checks "$" prefix on cost, verifies active agents strip, cost summary chart, recent activity + upcoming work widgets ✓
- `dashboard-navigation.md`: 12 steps — clicks each stat card, verifies correct navigation (Active Agents→/agents, Pending Proposals→/items, Needs Attention→/activity, Today's Cost→/settings), back-button restores dashboard, tests "View all" link ✓
- Both files follow template format (Objective/Prerequisites/Steps/Expected Results/Failure Criteria) ✓
- References UI by visible text, not implementation details ✓
- Navigation targets verified against dashboard.tsx StatCard definitions ✓
- Build: no code changes, no impact ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

## 2026-03-30 — Review: AI.1 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Test plan directory structure and template.
- `tests/e2e/plans/` directory with `_template.md` ✓
- `tests/e2e/results/` directory (empty, ready for output) ✓
- README: framework overview, 5 prerequisites, 6 MCP tools listed, directory structure ✓
- Template: all 5 required sections (Objective, Prerequisites, Steps, Expected Results, Failure Criteria) ✓
- Steps template shows patterns for navigate, verify, click, type, screenshot ✓
- References UI by visible text, aria labels, selectors — not implementation details ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — AI.1: Create test plan directory structure and template

**Task:** Create test plan directory structure, README, and template file.

**Done:**
- Created `tests/e2e/plans/` and `tests/e2e/results/` directories
- Created `tests/e2e/README.md`: explains the AI-based E2E test framework, prerequisites (backend :3001, frontend :5173, API mode, seeded DB, chrome-devtools MCP), how to run a test plan (6 key MCP tools listed), test plan format overview, directory structure
- Created `tests/e2e/plans/_template.md`: standard format with `## Objective`, `## Prerequisites`, `## Steps` (numbered actions with target/expected patterns for navigate, verify, click, type, screenshot), `## Expected Results`, `## Failure Criteria`. Steps reference UI elements by visible text, aria labels, or semantic selectors.

**Files created:** `tests/e2e/README.md`, `tests/e2e/plans/_template.md`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors. Non-code files only — no source changes.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.9 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Backend routes project scoping audit.
- Independently verified all 8 routes via grep: work-items, executions, comments, proposals, dashboard/* ✓
- Each accepts `?projectId=` in Querystring type and destructures it ✓
- work-items: `eq(workItems.projectId, projectId)` ✓
- executions/comments/proposals: work item membership pattern ✓
- dashboard (4 routes): all filter by projectId ✓
- No code changes needed — verification-only pass is correct ✓
- Verdict: **approved**
- **Sprint 15 complete** — all 10 tasks (PS.1-PS.10) approved.

---

## 2026-03-30 — PS.9: Audit backend routes for project scoping

**Task:** Audit all backend list routes for `?projectId=` query param support.

**Done — Verification pass (no fixes needed):**
All 8 routes already have proper `?projectId=` filtering, implemented in PS.3–PS.5:
- `GET /api/work-items` — filters via `eq(workItems.projectId, projectId)` (PS.3)
- `GET /api/executions` — fetches project work items, filters by ID membership (PS.5)
- `GET /api/comments` — same membership pattern (PS.5)
- `GET /api/proposals` — same membership pattern (PS.5)
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` — filters work items + executions + proposals (PS.4)
- `GET /api/dashboard/cost-summary` — filters executions by project (PS.4)
- `GET /api/dashboard/execution-stats` — filters executions by project (PS.4)
- `GET /api/dashboard/ready-work` — filters via `eq(workItems.projectId)` + `and()` (PS.4)

**Files modified:** None (audit only — `TASKS.md` and `WORKLOG.md` updated)

**Notes:** `GET /api/audit` (not in task scope) uses file-based JSONL storage and only supports `workItemId` filter. Could be enhanced later if needed.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.10 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Folder browser for project creation/edit form.
- Backend: `POST /api/settings/browse-directory` accepts `{ startPath? }`, defaults to `homedir()`, returns `{ currentPath, entries }` ✓
- Uses `readdirSync` with `withFileTypes`, filters directories only, hides dotfiles, sorts alphabetically ✓
- Error handling: catches unreadable directories, returns 400 ✓
- Frontend API: `browseDirectory()`, `DirectoryEntry`, `BrowseDirectoryResult` types ✓
- FolderBrowser modal: Dialog with breadcrumb bar (clickable root + segments), ScrollArea listing, ".." parent nav, loading/error/empty states ✓
- ProjectForm: text input preserved with FolderOpen icon + "Browse..." button ✓
- Dark mode: uses muted-foreground, accent, bg-muted/50 ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — PS.10: Add folder browser to project creation form

**Task:** Replace text input for project path with a folder picker (text input + "Browse..." button + modal folder browser).

**Done:**
- **Backend**: Added `POST /api/settings/browse-directory` route to `packages/backend/src/routes/settings.ts`. Accepts `{ startPath?: string }`, defaults to `os.homedir()`. Returns `{ currentPath, entries: [{ name, path, isDirectory }] }`. Uses `readdirSync` with `withFileTypes`, filters to directories only, hides dotfiles, sorts alphabetically. Returns 400 on unreadable directories.
- **Frontend API**: Added `browseDirectory()`, `DirectoryEntry`, and `BrowseDirectoryResult` types to `packages/frontend/src/api/client.ts`.
- **Frontend UI**: Rewrote `ProjectForm` in `packages/frontend/src/features/settings/projects-section.tsx`:
  - Text input preserved with FolderOpen icon (for accessibility/direct typing)
  - Added "Browse..." button next to the input
  - Added `FolderBrowser` modal component: Dialog with breadcrumb path bar (clickable segments), scrollable directory listing, ".." parent navigation, "Select" button to confirm. Prepopulates at current path or home directory.
  - Uses shadcn Dialog, ScrollArea, Button components. Dark mode compatible.

**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/routes/settings.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/api/client.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/features/settings/projects-section.tsx`

**Notes:** Build: 0 errors after removing unused `statSync` import. The `browseDirectory` call is made directly from the component (not through the mock/real pick layer) since it's only meaningful with a real backend — mock mode has no filesystem to browse.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.8 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Auto-seed default personas on project creation.
- 5 built-in personas with correct configs (names, colors, icons, models, tools, budgets) matching seed.ts ✓
- Router has `{ isSystem: true }` settings ✓
- Conditional seeding: only inserts personas if none exist in DB ✓
- Falls back to DB lookup if personas already exist ✓
- Default state→persona assignments match seed.ts mapping (5 states) ✓
- Called from POST /api/projects after project insert ✓
- System prompts intentionally empty (user-customizable via Persona Manager) — acceptable ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — PS.8: Auto-seed default personas on project creation

**Task:** When creating a new project via the API, seed built-in personas if none exist, and create default persona assignments for the new project.

**Done:**
- Created `packages/backend/src/db/default-personas.ts` with:
  - `BUILT_IN_PERSONAS` array: 5 personas (Product Manager, Tech Lead, Engineer, Code Reviewer, Router) with same config as seed.ts
  - `DEFAULT_STATE_ASSIGNMENTS` mapping: Planning→PM, Decomposition→Tech Lead, Ready→Router, In Progress→Engineer, In Review→Code Reviewer
  - `seedDefaultPersonasForProject(projectId)` function: checks if any personas exist; if not, inserts the 5 built-ins. Then creates persona assignments for the given project using the default mapping.
- Updated `packages/backend/src/routes/projects.ts`: POST /api/projects now calls `seedDefaultPersonasForProject(id)` after inserting the project row.

**Files created:** `packages/backend/src/db/default-personas.ts`
**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/routes/projects.ts`

**Notes:** Persona definitions are intentionally without full system prompts (empty string) — the seed.ts has detailed prompts but those are fixture-specific. The personas table defaults `systemPrompt` to `""`. Build: 0 errors after removing unused `PersonaId` import.

---

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.7 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Empty states for new projects.
- Work Items list: `EmptyWorkItemsState` component with icon, heading, description, and "Create work item" button ✓
- Properly distinguishes empty project vs. no filter matches via `hasFilters` check ✓
- Activity feed: "No activity yet" with project-scoped message ✓
- Dashboard recent-activity: "No activity yet" ✓
- Dashboard stats: handles zero gracefully via `?? 0` defaults ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — PS.7: Show empty state for new projects

**Task:** Show friendly empty states when a project has zero work items.

**Done:**
- **Work Items list view**: Added `EmptyWorkItemsState` component — large icon, "No work items yet" heading, descriptive text, prominent "Create work item" button with Plus icon. Replaces the old plain text empty state (filter empty state kept separate).
- **Activity feed**: Updated empty state text from "Nothing yet" to "No activity yet" with project-scoped message.
- **Dashboard recent-activity widget**: Updated empty text to "No activity yet".
- **Dashboard stats**: Already handles zero gracefully via `?? 0` defaults — shows "0" not NaN/errors.

**Files modified:** `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/list-view.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/activity-feed/activity-feed.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/dashboard/recent-activity.tsx`

**Notes:** Added `Button`, `Plus`, `ListTodo`, `useCreateWorkItem`, `ProjectId` imports to list-view. Build: 0 errors after type cast fix.

---

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.6 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Persona assignment scoping and hardcoded project ID removal.
- Hook: `usePersonaAssignments(ProjectId | null)` with `enabled: !!projectId` guard, non-null assertions safe behind guard ✓
- detail-panel.tsx: passes `projectId` from `useSelectedProject()` ✓
- board-view.tsx: passes `projectId` from `useSelectedProject()` ✓
- workflow-config-section.tsx: removed `PROJECT_ID` constant, uses `useSelectedProject()`, null guard on mutation ✓
- work-items.tsx: quick-add uses dynamic `projectId` with null guard ✓
- Zero `pj-agntops`/`PROJECT_ID` references outside fixtures.ts ✓
- Unused `ProjectId` imports cleaned ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**
- **Sprint 15 Core Wiring complete** — all 6 tasks (PS.1-PS.6) approved.

---

## 2026-03-30 — PS.6: Scope persona assignments to selected project

**Task:** Remove hardcoded `"pj-agntops"` project IDs from all persona assignment call sites, use `useSelectedProject()` instead.

**Done:**
- Updated `usePersonaAssignments` hook to accept `ProjectId | null` with `enabled: !!projectId` guard (same pattern as `useProject`)
- Replaced hardcoded `"pj-agntops" as ProjectId` in `detail-panel.tsx` → uses `projectId` from `useSelectedProject()`
- Replaced hardcoded `"pj-agntops" as ProjectId` in `board-view.tsx` → uses `projectId` from `useSelectedProject()`
- Removed `const PROJECT_ID = "pj-agntops"` from `workflow-config-section.tsx` → uses `projectId` from `useSelectedProject()`
- Fixed `updateAssignment.mutate` in workflow config to use dynamic `projectId` with null guard
- Also fixed hardcoded `projectId` in `work-items.tsx` quick-add handler → uses `projectId` from `useSelectedProject()`
- Removed unused `ProjectId` type imports from `board-view.tsx` and `detail-panel.tsx`

**Files modified:** `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-persona-assignments.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/detail-panel.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/board-view.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/settings/workflow-config-section.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/pages/work-items.tsx`

**Notes:** Zero hardcoded `"pj-agntops"` references remain outside fixtures.ts. Build: 0 errors after removing unused imports.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.5 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Scoping executions, comments, and proposals to selected project — full stack.
- Backend: all 3 routes accept `?projectId=`, consistent pattern (`if (projectId && !workItemId)` → filter by workItem membership) ✓
- API client: `getExecutions`/`getProposals` use URLSearchParams, `getRecentComments` appends query param ✓
- Mock API: all 3 functions filter by workItem ID set when projectId provided ✓
- API index: `getRecentComments` fixed from zero-arg to forwarding args ✓
- Query keys: `executions`, `proposals`, `recentComments` include projectId ✓
- Hooks: all 3 accept optional projectId ✓
- Call sites: 0 bare calls remain (grep confirmed) ✓
- Activity feed + recent-activity: all 3 hooks pass projectId ✓
- Agent monitor: layout, sidebar, history, split-view all scoped ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

---

## 2026-03-30 — PS.5: Scope executions, comments, and proposals to selected project

**Task:** Scope top-level execution, proposal, and comment listings to the selected project.

**Done:**
- **Backend**: Added `?projectId=` support to `GET /api/executions`, `GET /api/proposals`, `GET /api/comments` — filters by workItem membership in project
- **API client** (`client.ts`): `getExecutions`, `getProposals`, `getRecentComments` accept optional `projectId`
- **Mock API** (`mocks/api.ts`): All 3 mock functions filter by project when `projectId` provided
- **API index** (`api/index.ts`): Fixed `getRecentComments` to forward args (was zero-arg)
- **Query keys**: `executions`, `proposals`, `recentComments` updated to include `projectId`
- **Hooks**: `useExecutions`, `useProposals`, `useRecentComments` accept optional `projectId`
- **Call sites** (9 files): sidebar, list-view, flow-view, active-agent-sidebar, split-view, agent-history, agent-monitor-layout, active-agents-strip, recent-activity, activity-feed — all pass `projectId ?? undefined`

**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/routes/executions.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/proposals.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/comments.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/api/client.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/api/index.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/mocks/api.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/query-keys.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-executions.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-proposals.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-comments.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/components/sidebar.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/list-view.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/flow-view.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/agent-monitor/active-agent-sidebar.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/agent-monitor/split-view.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/agent-monitor/agent-history.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/agent-monitor/agent-monitor-layout.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/dashboard/recent-activity.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/dashboard/active-agents-strip.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/activity-feed/activity-feed.tsx`

**Notes:** Initial build failure — `getRecentComments` in api/index.ts was a zero-arg wrapper, fixed to forward args. Build: 0 errors after fix.

---

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.4 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Dashboard query scoping — full stack from backend to call sites.
- Backend: all 4 routes accept `?projectId=`, filter workItems then scope executions/proposals by workItemId set ✓
- API client: all 4 functions accept `projectId?`, append query param ✓
- Mock API: all 4 mock functions filter by projectId when provided ✓
- Query keys: static→function, returns unscoped when no projectId (TanStack prefix matching for invalidation works) ✓
- Hooks: all 4 accept and pass `projectId?` ✓
- Call sites: grep confirms 0 bare calls — all pass `projectId ?? undefined` ✓
- Invalidation: `use-proposals.ts` fixed to `["dashboardStats"]` raw key, WS sync already uses raw keys ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

## 2026-03-30 — PS.4: Scope dashboard queries to selected project

**Task:** Update dashboard hooks, backend routes, API client, mock API, and call sites to accept and filter by `projectId`.

**Done:**
- **Backend** (`dashboard.ts`): All 4 routes (`/stats`, `/cost-summary`, `/execution-stats`, `/ready-work`) now accept `?projectId=` query param. Filter work items by projectId, then filter executions/proposals by work item membership.
- **API client** (`client.ts`): All 4 dashboard functions accept optional `projectId`, append as query param.
- **Mock API** (`mocks/api.ts`): All 4 mock functions accept `projectId`, filter in-memory data accordingly.
- **Query keys** (`query-keys.ts`): Dashboard keys changed from static arrays to functions accepting `projectId`.
- **Hooks** (`use-dashboard.ts`): All 4 hooks accept optional `projectId`, pass to query key + queryFn.
- **Call sites updated**: sidebar.tsx, status-bar.tsx, dashboard.tsx, cost-summary.tsx, upcoming-work.tsx, costs-section.tsx (2 components)
- **Fixed**: `use-proposals.ts` invalidation used static `queryKeys.dashboardStats` — changed to raw `["dashboardStats"]` for prefix matching.

**Files modified:** `packages/backend/src/routes/dashboard.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/api/client.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/mocks/api.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/query-keys.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-proposals.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/components/sidebar.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/components/status-bar.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/dashboard/cost-summary.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/dashboard/upcoming-work.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/features/settings/costs-section.tsx`

**Notes:** Build initially failed due to unused `inArray` import — removed. Build: 0 errors after fix.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.3 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Scoping all useWorkItems() call sites to selected project.
- Zero bare `useWorkItems()` calls remain — grep confirms all scoped ✓
- 10 files updated: 10 imports + 10 destructures of `useSelectedProject` (20 occurrences) ✓
- Correct pattern: `useWorkItems(undefined, projectId ?? undefined)` — null→undefined conversion for optional param ✓
- Hook chain: `useWorkItems(parentId?, projectId?)` → `queryKeys.workItems` → `getWorkItems` passes projectId through ✓
- All files listed in task description covered (list-view, board-view, flow-view, filter-bar, detail-panel, command-palette, 4 agent-monitor components) ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

## 2026-03-30 — PS.3: Scope work items queries to selected project

**Task:** Update all `useWorkItems()` call sites to pass `projectId` from `useSelectedProject()`.

**Done:**
- Updated 10 files to import `useSelectedProject` and pass `projectId` to `useWorkItems(undefined, projectId ?? undefined)`
- Call sites: list-view, filter-bar, board-view, flow-view, detail-panel, command-palette, active-agent-sidebar, agent-control-bar, split-view, agent-history

**Files modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/list-view.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/filter-bar.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/board-view.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/flow-view.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/detail-panel.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/command-palette/command-palette.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/agent-monitor/active-agent-sidebar.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/agent-monitor/agent-control-bar.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/agent-monitor/split-view.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/agent-monitor/agent-history.tsx`

**Notes:** The `useWorkItems` hook already accepted `projectId` as second param — callers just weren't passing it. Used `projectId ?? undefined` to convert null→undefined matching the optional param type. Build: 0 errors.

## 2026-03-30 — Review: PS.2 (approved)

**Reviewed:** useSelectedProject hook and useProject null-safety update.
- Hook reads `selectedProjectId` from UI store via selector, casts to `ProjectId | null` ✓
- Fetches full project via `useProject(selectedProjectId)` — passes nullable ID ✓
- Returns `{ project, projectId, isLoading }` — correct shape, `project ?? null` normalizes undefined ✓
- `useProject` updated: `ProjectId | null` param, `enabled: !!id`, non-null assertions safe behind guard ✓
- No existing callers broken: grep confirms only `useSelectedProject` consumes `useProject()` ✓
- Exported from `hooks/index.ts` barrel ✓
- Build: 0 errors ✓
- Verdict: **approved**

## 2026-03-30 — PS.2: Create useSelectedProject hook

**Task:** Create `use-selected-project.ts` hook as single source of truth for the selected project.

**Done:**
- Created `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-selected-project.ts`: reads `selectedProjectId` from `useUIStore`, fetches full project via `useProject(id)`, returns `{ project, projectId, isLoading }`
- Updated `useProject` in `use-projects.ts` to accept `ProjectId | null` with `enabled: !!id` — prevents broken fetch when no project is selected
- Exported `useSelectedProject` from `hooks/index.ts` barrel

**Files created:** `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-selected-project.ts`
**Files modified:** `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-projects.ts`, `packages/frontend/src/hooks/index.ts`

**Notes:** `useProject` previously only accepted `ProjectId` (non-null). Updated to accept null with `enabled` guard so downstream hooks like `useSelectedProject` work correctly when no project is selected. Build: 0 errors.

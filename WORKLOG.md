## 2026-04-02 15:15 PDT — CWF.12: Update flow-view.tsx to use dynamic workflow states

**Done:** Updated `packages/frontend/src/features/work-items/flow-view.tsx`. Replaced `WORKFLOW` import with `useWorkflowStates(workflowId)` hook. Gets `workflowId` from `project.workflowId`. `mainStates` and `blockedState` computed via useMemo from dynamic data. State colors come from DB. `stateData` map initialized from `workflowStatesData`. Blocked branch index dynamically calculated from mainStates length. Filter panel color lookup uses `workflowStatesData`. Blocked card uses dynamic `blockedState.name` and `blockedState.color`.

## 2026-04-02 14:10 PDT — Review: CWF.8 (approved)

**Reviewed:** Dynamic router prompt in router.ts.
- buildDynamicRouterPrompt() imported from workflow-runtime ✓
- Hardcoded state list removed from ROUTER_BASE_PROMPT ✓
- buildRouterSystemPrompt() now async, injects "Workflow Context" from dynamic transitions ✓

- **Verdict: approved.** Backend Runtime phase (CWF.4-8) complete.

---

## 2026-04-02 14:05 PDT — CWF.8: Dynamic router prompt from workflow

**Done:** Updated `packages/backend/src/agent/router.ts`. Replaced hardcoded state list in `ROUTER_BASE_PROMPT` with generic guidelines. `buildRouterSystemPrompt()` now async — calls `buildDynamicRouterPrompt(workflowId, currentState)` to inject "Workflow Context" section with valid target states from the work item's workflow. `runRouter()` now selects `workflowId` + `currentState` from work item and passes to prompt builder. Router persona creation uses base prompt (dynamic context added per-run).
**Files:** `packages/backend/src/agent/router.ts`
**Notes:** Backend Runtime phase (CWF.4-8) complete. All 5 backend files now use dynamic workflow functions.

## 2026-04-02 13:50 PDT — CWF.7: Update MCP server tools for dynamic workflow

**Done:** Updated 3 MCP tools in `packages/backend/src/agent/mcp-server.ts`. `route_to_state`: selects workflowId, validates via `isValidTransitionDynamic()` instead of sync `isValidTransition()`. `create_children`: selects parent's workflowId, resolves initial state via `getWorkflowInitialState()`, inherits `workflowId` on child items. `flag_blocked`: queries workflow states via `getWorkflowStates()` to find "Blocked" state by name (case-insensitive), uses dynamic name in update and broadcast. Replaced `WORKFLOW` and `isValidTransition` imports with workflow-runtime functions.
**Files:** `packages/backend/src/agent/mcp-server.ts`

## 2026-04-02 12:50 PDT — CWF.3: Seed default workflow

**Done:** Created `packages/backend/src/db/seed-workflow.ts` with `seedDefaultWorkflow()`. Uses fixed ID `wf-default` for idempotency. Inserts default workflow (8 states from WORKFLOW constant with type classification: Backlog=initial, Done=terminal, rest=intermediate). Creates all valid transitions from WORKFLOW.transitions. Deterministic state IDs (`ws-default-backlog`, etc.) and transition IDs. Backfills `projects.workflowId` and `work_items.workflowId` where null. Wired into startup in `start.ts` after migrations + personas via dynamic import.

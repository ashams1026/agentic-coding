- [x] **E.10** — Handle stale execution cleanup on server restart. Orphaned running executions → failed, clear concurrency tracker. *(completed 2026-03-30)*

### Frontend ↔ Backend Wiring

- [x] **E.1** — Fix API client response parsing. Audited client.ts response shapes, fixed mismatches with backend, added error handling with toast notifications. *(completed 2026-03-30)*
